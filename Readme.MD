## Build

1) Generate the build files: Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, create a new directory named build (if it doesn't exist already), navigate into it, and run ```cmake ..```
to generate the build files.

2) Build the project: Still in the build directory, run ```cmake --build .``` to build your project. This will compile all your source files and test files into executables.

3) Run the test: After building the project, you should have an executable named test_MyClass in your build directory. You can run it with ```./test_MyClass``` (on Unix-based systems) or test_MyClass.exe (on Windows).
